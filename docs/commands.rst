================
Target interface
================

The implementations generated by **pyecsca** provide a serial
interface somewhat adhering to the ChipWhisperer_ SimpleSerial interface.

They provide 10 commands (some may be disabled). The commands
all start with a single ASCII lowercase character and then a HEX
payload, like::

    i1234deadbeef

Responses from the implementation are formatted in the same way, with
the exception of the :code:`z` response, which is inherent to the SimpleSerial
protocol and is send after every command finishes processing.

Encoding
========

Payloads
--------

Command payloads are either raw, in which case the payload is an unformatted byte string, or they are encoded.

Encoded payloads consist of a tree Name-Length-Value structure.

**Name**: Single lowercase ASCII character, if it has the MSB set, it is a node in
the tree which has children.

**Length**: Single unsigned byte.

**Value**: Either a byte string, if the node is a leaf, or a byte string which
is an encoding of one or several Name-Length-Value structures.

Points
------

Affine points are a structure of two coordinates, :code:`x` and :code:`y`.

Points in implementation defined coordinate systems have different coordinate names.

Integers
--------

Big-endian.
